  h1 ZXCoin Trade End-User License Agreement
  hr
  p Welcome to the ZXCoin software client <strong>ZXCoin Trade</strong>
    | provided by ZXCoin Labs, Inc. (“we” or “us”).  ZXCoin Trade is a version of the open source
    | ZXCoin software client that allows users to access the decentralized ZXCoin transaction protocol
    | payment network ("ZXCoin Protocol").  Source code for ZXCoin Trade and related software is available
    | free of charge under open source software license agreements at <a href="https://github.com/ripple">https://github.com/ripple</a>  We hope
    | you find ZXCoin Trade to be useful as a tool to access and use the ZXCoin Protocol.
  p Please read this End User License Agreement <strong>EULA</strong> carefully as it explains your and
    | our respective rights and responsibilities associated with your access to, and use of, ZXCoin Trade.
  p 1. <strong>ZXCOIN PROTOCOL</strong>. You understand that ZXCoin Trade allows you to interact directly
    | with the ZXCoin Protocol to create a ZXCoin Protocol wallet (“ZXCoin Wallet”), initiate payments
    | postings to the ZXCoin Protocol as well as view transaction histories and balances available via the
    | ZXCoin Protocol.  You understand that ZXCoin Trade itself does not process payments, or hold
    | transaction histories and balances and is merely a tool for initiating actions that occur within the
    | ZXCoin Protocol and viewing the record of those actions.  You understand that actual payments are
    | processed via the ZXCoin Protocol, not ZXCoin Trade, and that resulting balances shown in ZXCoin
    | Trade are (i) actually held by third parties or (ii) in the case of ZXC, held through a chain of
    | custody documented on the ZXCoin Protocol public ledger (“The Ledger”).  You acknowledge and agree
    | that we have no control, responsibility or authority over such third parties.  ZXCoin Trade merely
    | interoperates with such entities via the ZXCoin Protocol.  For more information about the ZXCoin
    | Protocol, including ZXCoin Protocol transaction fees, please visit the <a href="https://ZXCoin.com/wiki/">ZXCoin Wiki</a>.  You further
    | acknowledge and agree that transactions you initiate within the ZXCoin Protocol will be available to
    | the public on the Internet via The Ledger.  ZXCoin Trade allows you to view the public payments data
    | posted for ZXCoin Wallets – including your own ZXCoin Wallet.  Once data is shared to the ZXCoin
    | Protocol, neither ZXCoin Trade nor any third party may selectively censor or blacklist access to, and
    | subsequent use of, such data.
  p 2. <strong>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</strong>. You may be able to access and use third-party content and
    | services displayed via ZXCoin Trade, such as gateway services (“Third-Party Services”), including
    | Third-Party Services that interact directly with the ZXCoin Protocol.  When using any Third-Party
    | Services, you are interacting directly with such services, not us, and you agree to comply with any
    | terms and conditions applicable to such services.  ZXCoin Trade may display or otherwise highlight
    | certain Third-Party Services for your convenience, but we do not endorse any Third-Party Services.
    | You are solely responsible for your use of any Third-Party Services.  We are not a party to, make no
    | representations or warranties as to, and have no responsibility or liability with respect to any of
    | your communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and
    | any third party providing the Third-Party Services, including any fees that may be charged to you in
    | connection with your use of any Third-Party Services.
  p 3. <strong>ZXCOIN WALLET DATA</strong>. Your ZXCoin Wallet, including any private and confidential data
    | accessible therein, is protected from unauthorized access and use by others via a secret key and
    | password held by you and not ZXCoin Trade.  ZXCoin Trade cannot assist you in recovering your secret
    | key and password.  It is your sole responsibility to keep your secret key and password protected from
    | unauthorized discovery.  ZXCoin Trade is not responsible for the consequences of another party
    | accessing and using your ZXCoin Wallet data because it is your sole responsibility to keep you secret
    | key and password from being accessed and used by unauthorized third parties.
  p 4. <strong>BLOCKING</strong>. You understand and agree that we may block excessive or abusive use of
    | ZXCoin Trade from a particular IP address at any point in time and for any length of time, in our
    | sole discretion.  Even if we block access to ZXCoin Trade, you may still access your ZXCoin Wallet
    | via other ZXCoin client software.
  p 5. <strong>ACCEPTABLE USE</strong>. You agree not use ZXCoin Trade to violate any applicable law,
    | contract, or third-party right or to engage in any transaction involving illegal products or
    | services.  You further agree not to:
  p - Use ZXCoin Trade in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect or inhibit
    | other users from fully enjoying ZXCoin Trade, or that could damage, disable, overburden or impair
    | the functioning of ZXCoin Trade in any manner;
  p - Attempt to circumvent any security techniques we employ, or attempt to access any service or area
    | of ZXCoin Trade that you are not authorized to access;
  p - Introduce to ZXCoin Trade any virus, trojan worms, logic bombs or other harmful material; and
  p - Encourage or induce any third party to engage in any of the activities prohibited under this Section.
  p 6. <strong>COPYRIGHT COMPLAINTS</strong>. If you believe anything on ZXCoin Trade infringes upon any
    | copyright which you own or control, you may file a notification of such infringement with our
    | Designated Agent as set forth below.

  p 7. <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>. MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND OTHER CONTRACT
    | PARTIES, LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS;
    | NOTHING HEREIN IS INTENDED TO WAIVE RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.
  p To the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) we make no promises as to ZXCoin Trade, its
    | completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, propriety, security or reliability; (b) your
    | access and use are at your own risk, and ZXCoin Trade is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”; and
    | (c) WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND OUR AND THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES
    | (“ZXCoin LAB ENTITIES”), DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES & CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT

    | NON-INFRINGEMENT.
  p 8. <strong>LIMITATION ON LIABILITY</strong>.
  p (A) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE ZXCoin LAB ENTITIES BE
    | LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS
    | (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL).  Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or
    | exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some of the limitations of this
    | section may not apply to you.
  p (B) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF
    | THE ZXCoin LAB ENTITIES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WHETHER ACTIVE,
    | PASSIVE OR IMPUTED), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
    | TO THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE ZXCoin TRADE OR TO THIS EULA EXCEED $100 U.S. DOLLARS.
  p 9. <strong>DISPUTES; INDEMNITY</strong>.  You agree (a) that any claim, cause of action and dispute
    | (“Claim”) arising out of or related to this EULA or your ZXCoin Trade use is governed by California
    | law regardless of your location or any conflict or choice of law principle; (b) that any Claim must
    | be resolved exclusively by state or federal court in San Francisco, California (except we may seek
    | injunctive remedy anywhere); (c) to submit to personal jurisdiction of said courts; (d) any Claim
    | filed later than 1 year after the facts giving rise to such Claim occurred are hereby waived and shall
    | be forever barred; and (e) (except government agencies) to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each
    | and all of the ZXCoin Lab Entities for any damage, loss, and expense (including, but not limited to,
    | attorneys’ fees) arising from any Claim related to this EULA or your ZXCoin Trade use.
  p 10. <strong>OTHER TERMS</strong>. This EULA contains the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
    | and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding ZXCoin Trade.  This EULA do not alter
    | the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with us for any other product or service
    | or otherwise.  In the event of any conflict between this EULA and any other agreement you may have with
    | us, the terms of that other agreement will control only if this EULA is specifically identified and
    | declared to be overridden by such other agreement.  Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power
    | or privilege under this EULA will not operate as a waiver thereof.  The invalidity or unenforceability
    | of any term in this EULA will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other term of this EULA,
    | all of which will remain in full force and effect.
